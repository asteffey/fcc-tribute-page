## Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Tribute Page

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/asteffey/fcc-tribute-page.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/asteffey/fcc-tribute-page)

This site is hosted at https://asteffey.github.io/fcc-tribute-page.  
Alternatively, it can be viewed with the [freeCodeCamp test suite](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js) 
by appending [`?fcc-test`](https://asteffey.github.io/fcc-tribute-page?fcc-test) to the URL.

This is a [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) project which uses HTML5, CSS3, and a little JavaScript to provide an example of a tribute page.
Additionally, this project has a basic CI/CD pipeline using Travis, with a Gulp file, and deployment to GitHub pages.

I choose Tim Berners-Lee as I thought he was a fitting choice for a project meant to demonstrate an understanding of HTML. 

The project requirements can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page.
